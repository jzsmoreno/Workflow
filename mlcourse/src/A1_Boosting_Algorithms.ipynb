    "# Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** The dataset is designed for predicting the `effectiveness` of various sales managers using the XGBoost algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **date**: Date of the observation, indicating when the data was collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id_manager**: Unique identifier for each sales manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id_business_line**: Unique identifier for each business line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **target_sales_manager**: A target metric related to the sales manager's goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **departamento**: Department where the sales manager operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **studies**: Educational qualifications of the sales manager, potentially impacting their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **generation**: The generational cohort the sales manager belongs to (e.g., Millennials, Gen X), which may influence their work style and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **location**: Geographical location where the sales manager operates, potentially affecting performance due to regional factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gender**: Gender of the sales manager, which could be a demographic variable for analyzing effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **age**: Age of the sales manager, which might correlate with experience and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **direct_boss**: The direct superior of the sales manager, which might influence the sales manager's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **position**: Job position of the sales manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rh_location**: Location of the human resources department.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **civil_status**: Civil status (e.g., single, married) of the sales manager, which could impact their personal and professional life balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cell_phone**: Contact number of the sales manager, which may be used for direct communication but may not be directly relevant for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **total_sales**: Total sales achieved by the sales manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **clients**: Number of clients handled by the sales manager, potentially influencing their sales performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **potential_clients**: Number of potential clients identified by the sales manager, indicating future sales opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **number_employees**: Number of employees under the sales managerâ€™s supervision, which could affect their workload and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **program**: Program or initiative the sales manager is involved in, which might be linked to their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **clients_ratio**: Ratio of clients to some other metric (e.g., total clients vs. potential clients), providing insight into client management efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sales_ratio**: Ratio of sales to another metric (e.g., total sales vs. target sales), which may reflect the sales manager's performance relative to targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **effectiveness**: Target variable representing the effectiveness of the sales manager, which the model aims to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains a mix of demographic, operational, and performance-related features about sales managers. The goal is to use these attributes to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the effectiveness of sales managers.\n"
